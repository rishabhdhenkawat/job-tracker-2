We are also recognized by Startup India. In the first foray, this technology fills up the awareness gap between the customer and offline retailer. There is no way for any user to find out about offers, deals, and sales running at store near them and on retailers front there is limited scope for stores to target and reach out to users in their vicinity, thus there occurs a communication gap between sellers and buyers regarding new products/offer/promotion. Even print, social and online medium fail to work in this area, therefore most considerable method adopted by stores these days is the distribution of pamphlets, a process that Dealzo aims to replace with personalization.About the work from home job/internshipSelected intern's day-to-day responsibilities include: 1.
